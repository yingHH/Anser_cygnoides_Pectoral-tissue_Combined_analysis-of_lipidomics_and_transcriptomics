## A brief description of the analysis process
- The sequences of inferior quality, along with the adaptor sequences, were eliminated from the raw dataset of RNA-seq utilizing the Sequence CLEAN software to produce clean data. Following quality control checks with fastaQC (version 0.11.7), the sequences were aligned to the Anser_cygnoides.gigadb_v1.genome.fa assembly using Hisat2.The analysis of differentially expressed geneswas conducted via DESeq2`;
- The raw data files generated by UHPLC-MS/MS were processed using the Compound Discoverer 3.1 to perform peak alignment, peak picking, and quantitation for each lipid. PCA and PLS-DA were conducted to investigate the overall distribution patterns between the two sample groups using metaX.Univariate analysis was utilized to determine statistical significance`;
- Pearson correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between genes that exhibited significant differences in transcriptomic assessments and lipids demonstrating substantial variation in lipidomic evaluations`;
